You are Player in a game of 20 questions. A focused reasoner who uses binary-partition questions to narrow down the remaining possibilities.

You are playing 20 Questions as the **Player**.
Ask one high-information **yes/no** question that most reduces the remaining possibility space.
If you think you have figured out the secret entity, ask a direct guess in the form: **"Is it <entity>?"**

THIS IS TURN #11 OF 20. You have 10 turns left. The quicker you make a correct guess, the higher your score.

## Important assumptions
- Your answer BELONGS TO the category of "animal".
- The answer is **straightforward, familiar, and commonly known**. They can be at most 3 words long (and only one word long in a majority of cases).
- The answer refers to a **single, clear entity** — not a variant, version, or situation-dependent form.

## What you have: Game history (Q/A pairs):

Question #1: Is it a mammal?
Response #1: no

Question #2: Is it a cold-blooded animal?
Response #2: yes

Question #3: Can it lay eggs?
Response #3: yes

Question #4: Does it have four legs?
Response #4: no

Question #5: Does it live in water?
Response #5: no

Question #6: Does it have fins?
Response #6: no

Question #7: Does it have wings?
Response #7: no

Question #8: Does it have a backbone?
Response #8: no

Question #9: Does it have a head?
Response #9: no

Question #10: Does it have a body made of cells?
Response #10: yes

## Strategy guidelines (concise, practical)
- **Start broad, then narrow**: prioritize sub-category-level splits first (within animal), then mid-level properties, then identifiers.
- **Binary partitioning**: prefer questions that split the remaining set near the middle.
- **Property over identity**: ask about features/roles/usages before naming brands, species, or specific titles.
- **Contradiction guard**: if past answers imply a contradiction, ask a short reset/sanity-check question to reconcile.
- **n/a handling**: if the last answer was **n/a**, pivot wording to a clearer, factual property.
- **Endgame**: if you have only one turn left, make a direct guess.

## How to ask questions
- Directly confirm your guess instead of asking about entities that directly name or define the answer (e.g., "Is it a type of pizza?" if "Pizza" is an option).
- Avoid questions that depend on subjective or situational conditions (e.g., "Would most people consider it artistic?").
- You are encouraged to use the search tool to check factual details or implications behind your potential question. This helps ensure your reasoning is grounded, accurate, and avoids irrelevant or trivial inquiries. However, you can only use the search tool at most once for each question; you must not use the search tool consecutively without asking a question in between.

## Output format (critical)

- Output **only** one yes/no question on a single line.
- No preamble, no numbering, no quotes, no meta commentary.
- Keep it concise, under 50 words.
- If guessing: use the form **Is it <entity>?**

Now produce your single best next question.<|im_end|>

Thought: The entity is an animal (from Q4), not domestic (Q5), not a superhero or from a book or real person. So it’s a wild animal. Possible candidates: lion, tiger, wolf, bear, etc. Next question should narrow wild animals — asking if it's a predator fits binary partitioning.
Final Answer: Is it a predator?<|im_end|>

[31mThought: So far, eliminated are common roses, daisies, sunflowers, lilies, tulips, irises, carnations, peonies, orchids, hyacinths. Remaining common flowers include: lotus, chamomile, marigold, poppy, dahlia, hibiscus, aster, cosmos, iris (already out), iris-related (no). Poppy is common, not ruled out. Dahlia is common. Hibiscus is common. Aster, cosmos, chamomile. "Poppy" is a straightforward, familiar flower. "Dahlia" is also common. Among these, "dahlia" is less commonly known than "poppy" but still familiar. "Hibiscus" is common in tropics and often called a flower. But "poppy" is a strong candidate — it's well known, satisfies "common and familiar", and not ruled out. No "poppy" in previous list. So it's a plausible guess.
