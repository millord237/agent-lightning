Remaining common flowers include: lotus, chamomile, marigold, poppy, dahlia, hibiscus, aster, cosmos, iris (already out), iris-related (no). Poppy is common, not ruled out. Dahlia is common. Hibiscus is common. Aster, cosmos, chamomile. "Poppy" is a straightforward, familiar flower. "Dahlia" is also common. Among these, "dahlia" is less commonly known than "poppy" but still familiar. "Hibiscus" is common in tropics and often called a flower. But "poppy" is a strong candidate — it's well known, satisfies "common and familiar", and not ruled out. No "poppy" in previous list. So it's a plausible guess.

[0m[33m- **Start broad, then narrow**: prioritize sub-category-level splits first (within character), then mid-level properties, then identifiers.
[0m[33m- **Binary partitioning**: prefer questions that split the remaining set near the middle.
[0m[33m- **Property over identity**: ask about features/roles/usages before naming brands, species, or specific titles.
[0m[33m- **Contradiction guard**: if past answers imply a contradiction, ask a short reset/sanity-check question to reconcile.
[0m[33m- **n/a handling**: if the last answer was **n/a**, pivot wording to a clearer, factual property.

[0m[33m## How to ask questions
[0m[33m- Directly confirm your guess instead of asking about entities that directly name or define the answer (e.g., "Is it a type of pizza?" if "Pizza" is an option).
[0m[33m- Avoid questions that depend on subjective or situational conditions (e.g., "Would most people consider it artistic?").
[0m[33m- You are encouraged to use the search tool to check factual details or implications behind your potential question. This helps ensure your reasoning is grounded, accurate, and avoids irrelevant or trivial inquiries. However, you can only use the search tool at most once for each question; you must not use the search tool consecutively without asking a question in between.
